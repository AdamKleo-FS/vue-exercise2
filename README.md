### Exercise
Query an API using a button with Axios to retrieve a list from that API, then populate Vuetify cards (v-card) with the data.

### Example:
- URL: https://www.dnd5eapi.co/api/classes
Returns a list of 12 classes.
Display relevant fields inside the cards with a good design.
Another Example:
- URL: https://swapi.dev/api/people
Returns a list of Star Wars characters, which should be displayed inside v-card components.
You can use any free API as long as you follow the example.

### Harry Potter API:

### Optional Challenges:
- Centralize API calls using Pinia Actions.
- Work with reusable components.
- Dockerize the application so the frontend can be executed independently
